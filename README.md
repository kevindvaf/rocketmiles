<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

    Using the tool of your choice as an automation framework write as many tests as you 
    think would be sufficient to test the Search functionality on the rocketmiles.com

  * behave 1.2.6
  * pipenv 2018.11.26

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

#### Python 3.6+

I used the system python3 since the only additional packages I needed there were pip3 and pipenv. Pipenv is used to handle the virtual environments replacing explicit use of pip3, venv, virtualenvwrapper, and activation of the venv.

```sh
apt install python3  # only necessaru of there is an older version on Ubuntu
apt install python3-pip
python3 -m pip install pipenv
```

### Installation
 
1. Clone the repo
```sh
cd <project directory>
git clone https:://github.com/kevindvaf/rocketmiles.git
```
2. Create the virtual environment
```sh
pipenv --three
```
3. Install Python packages
```sh
pipenv install behave
pipenv install selenium
```
